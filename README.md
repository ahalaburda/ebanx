# ebanx-home-assignment

This is my submission to the EBANX home assignment during the inteview process

## Instalation

Made with FastApi, so you install first Python 3 and pip to install all the necesaray dependencies, if you have installed just run
```
pip install -r requiremets.txt
```
then, next run the project

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
and with that just enjoy.
