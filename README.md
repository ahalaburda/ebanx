# ebanx-home-assignment

This is my submission to the EBANX home assignment during the inteview process.

## Instalation

Made with [I'm an inline-style link](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), so you need install first Python 3 and pip to later install all the nece dependencies, if you have installed just run
```
pip install -r requiremets.txt
```
then, next run the project

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
and with that just enjoy.
